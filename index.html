            <h3>Journey of Programming</h3>
            <p> My programming journey is not easy. First of all, I wasn't interested in it. I was wasting my time
                gossiping,
                reading some stories, and doing this kind of stupidity. But then came into my life the man who was very
                introverted. He taught me what a program is. Why should I learn this? What is his job in the future? At
                first I
                was a little excited , but when time came to lose her, I started this programming
                again. Once you understand the fun of it, I don't want to go away anymore. Finally, programming is not
                that
                hard. You have to pay attention to it and it takes some time, which in turn leads to a lot of success.
